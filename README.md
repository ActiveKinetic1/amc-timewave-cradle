## 📄 Summary

This study establishes the governing behaviour of the **Active Magnetic Cradle (AMC)**, a macroscopic oscillator system that exhibits reproducible deviations from classical mechanics.

Across 15 case studies, AMC systems demonstrate:
- Structured energy handovers
- Wavelet memory persistence
- Quantized decay bands
- Temporal symmetry behaviour

These effects challenge conventional damping and oscillator theory, and are formalized into the **AMC Law Framework** — a suite of laws describing new principles of macroscopic field-coherent oscillation.

📌 **Note:** This research forms the scientific foundation of the patented **Repelling Magnetic Instrument (RMI)** system, and defines its governing temporal dynamics through the AMC Law Framework.

## ⏳ What is a “Timewave”?

The term **timewave** is introduced in this repository to describe the structured, reversible, and temporally-encoded wavelet oscillations observed in AMC systems. These waveforms are distinct from classical oscillators:

- They maintain **coherent energy handovers** across multiple cycles
- They exhibit **memory-like behaviour** across decay bands
- They evolve in **phase-symmetric, time-reversible sequences**

This makes them ideal for modeling **nonlinear, nonclassical magnetic motion** — a central theme of AMC research.

While not part of the original Zenodo publication vocabulary, “timewave” serves as a **shorthand descriptor** for the distinct field-coherent, temporal wavelet dynamics at the heart of AMC.
